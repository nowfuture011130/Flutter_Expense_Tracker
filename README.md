# Flutter_Expense_Tracker

I have developed an Expense Tracker that uses facial recognition and blockchain technology to ensure security. I used Python for the backend and Flutter for the frontend.

Hereâ€™s how the project works:

On the main screen, you need to either select a photo for facial recognition or use the camera to capture one. The backend will then attempt to verify if the photo matches the one stored in the system. If the match is successful, you will proceed to the Expense Tracker interface. If not, an error message will be displayed indicating that the photo is incorrect.

Once on the Expense Tracker screen, you can choose to either deposit or withdraw funds. All transaction records are stored on the blockchain, leveraging its immutability and decentralized nature to ensure the security of the records.

Additionally, I used Ganache to simulate Ether transactions. You can also view all transaction records within the app.
